# DOTA2-OutcomePredictor
A.I based Python application built with Django, which tries to predict the outcome of a certain dota 2 game, based on multiple parameters. I created this website using css and html.  

## Features
>**Predicting** - I am using Support-Vector Machines as my model of choice for this website. In the future I also might add an option to switch between the current one and KNN, just for the sake of having more options and a more solid answer in the end.

## Developer Note
After testing the model multiple times using the website. I noticed that it has an okayish prediction rate. Some games yelded strange results, but for the majority of the games, considering the supplied data, the model did well. I do not think the model could be used for a real game of dota, as it has too low of a score currently and a normal game has too many variables.
